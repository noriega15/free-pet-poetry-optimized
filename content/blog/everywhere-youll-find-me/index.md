# **Finding Solace in Remembrance**

Dear friend, don't let sorrow cloud your day,

Though I've left, I'm never far away.

I'm right beside you, near and near,

In your heart, I'm always here.

<br>Though my body's gone, my spirit's around,

In all the things you touch and sound.

I'm as free as the breeze, yet close, you see,

As long as you hold my memory.

<br>I won't vanish from your watchful eyes,

I'm the brightest star in the nighttime skies.

You'll always find me within your reach,

Like the warm sand on the beach.

<br>When autumn leaves paint the ground with grace,

I'm the colors that brighten your space.

In wintertime, I'm the pure white snow,

Covering the earth with a tranquil glow.

<br>When spring blossoms in beauty so rare,

I'm the first bud in the morning air.

I'm the sunrise's gentle, golden ray,

And the moon's soothing light, come what may.

<br>When you feel all alone and sad to the core,

I'll be with you through the Lord you implore.

In leaves' whispers and the gentle breeze,

You'll feel my presence, a soothing ease.

<br>I'm the tear that falls when you cry,

And the dreams that grace your sleep's sky.

I'm the smile on a baby's sweet face,

Just look around, friend, in every place.
