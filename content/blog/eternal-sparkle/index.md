# **A Tribute to a Beloved Friend**

In memory of me, your dear friend so true,

I've left this world, but I'm never far from you.

Though I'm not there, in the flesh, it's true,

My spirit surrounds you, in everything you do.

<br>I'm like glitter in the wind, scattered and light,

Everywhere you look, a speck of me shines bright.

With every star that graces the night sky,

A twinkle of me, as the days go by.

<br>Please don't shed tears, for I'm not really gone,

In cherished memories, I'll linger on.

I'm in your laughter, in the love that remains,

A part of your soul that knows no pain.

<br>Though I've journeyed to a world unseen,

Our bond's unbroken, like a dream within a dream.

With every petal that gently falls from a tree,

A speck of me remains for eternity.

<br>So, don't you cry, for I'm forever near,

In the quiet moments, when the world seems still,

Close your eyes and feel me, with a heart that's filled.

For I am never truly gone, you see,

I'm a part of the love, the bond that will forever be.
