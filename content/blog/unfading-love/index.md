# **A Poem of Comfort and Love**

In the still moments, as the day grows late,

I long for you, my dear, my heart feels its weight.

Tears roll down my cheeks, I feel so small,

I yearn for you, but you're beyond my call.

<br>I tried my best, my dear, to keep you near,

To shield you from pain, my constant fear.

If love alone could have made you stay,

You'd be here now, my lifelong mate.

<br>You've etched a place deep within my heart's embrace,

A void no other can fill, nor ever replace.

Your old spot, where you used to rest,

Now sits empty, an ache in my chest.

<br>Though you've ventured to a world unknown,

Your spirit's light in my heart is brightly shone.

You're forever missed, never to fade away,

In the quiet hours, in my thoughts, you'll stay.

<br>Until we reunite, my dearest friend,

Your memory remains, unwavering, until the end.

For our love is beyond the grasp of time,

In the rhythm of my heart, you stand the test of time.
