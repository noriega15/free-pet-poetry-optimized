# **A Tribute to Our Beloved Pets**

Losing a pet is a wound that never truly heals,

For many days, their absence is what the heart still keenly feels.

Some left us many years ago, others not so long,

But in our hearts, their memories remain vivid and strong.

<br>Their love was pure, a guiding light so bright,

An unbreakable bond, a source of pure delight.

No love from humans could quite compare,

Their deep devotion, a love so wonderfully rare.

<br>In their eyes, we found solace and joy so sweet,

Their wagging tails, a happiness that couldn't be beat.

No matter how much time passes on this way,

Their absence lingers, like a shadow every day.

<br>Each pet had a unique and precious soul,

Their absence leaves a void that takes its toll.

We'll hold their memories close in our heart's embrace,

Though they're gone, they're still an integral part of this place.

<br>Through the years, their love we'll forever carry,

In our thoughts and dreams, their spirits won't vary.

For the loss of our pets, we'll always mourn,

Their love and presence, from which we still draw warmth.
