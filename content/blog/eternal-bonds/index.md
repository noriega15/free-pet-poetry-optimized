# **A Canine's Tale of Love and Time**

In the dawn of days, a puppy I was found,
With eyes so bright, and joy unbound.
My tiny paws, a world to explore,
Innocence and wonder, I couldn't ask for more.

My owner, a heart like a child, full of cheer,
Together we danced, through each sunny day.
I grew with their love, by their side I'd stay,
Unaware of time's march, as we danced and swayed.

But now I stand, with the weight of the years,
My coat's turned gray, brushed by joys and tears.
As young as I look, my spirit still bold,
I've seen many stories, both tender and old.

Time, a swift river, it carries us on,
The sunsets and moonrise, they don't linger long.
For every year my owner does gain,
I age sevenfold, yet love still remains.

I ponder the future, uncertain and vast,
One day I'll leave, it's a truth that will last.
But until that time, let my owner know,
Love shall prevail, like the softest of snow.

For in every touch, in each loving gaze,
We've etched in our hearts, the sunniest of days.
As young as I look, I'll treasure the grace,
Of the love we've shared, in this beautiful place.
