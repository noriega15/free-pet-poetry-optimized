# **A Canine's Tale of Love and Time**

<br>In the dawn of days, a puppy I was found,

My tiny paws, a world to explore,

Innocence and wonder, I couldn't ask for more.

<br>My owner, a heart like a child, full of cheer,

Together we danced, through each sunny day.

I grew with their love, by their side I'd stay,

Unaware of time's march, as we danced and swayed.

<br>But now I stand, with the weight of the years,

My coat's turned gray, brushed by joys and tears.

As young as I look, my spirit still bold,

I've seen many stories, both tender and old.

<br>Time, a swift river, it carries us on,

The sunsets and moonrise, they don't linger long.

For every year my owner does gain,

I age sevenfold, yet love still remains.

<br>I ponder the future, uncertain and vast,

One day I'll leave, it's a truth that will last.

But until that time, let my owner know,

Love shall prevail, like the softest of snow.

<br>For in every touch, in each loving gaze,

We've etched in our hearts, the sunniest of days.

As young as I look, I'll treasure the grace,

Of the love we've shared, in this beautiful place.
