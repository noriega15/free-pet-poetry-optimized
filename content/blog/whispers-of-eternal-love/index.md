# **A Journey Through Time and Embrace**

In the quiet hours when the world's asleep,
I stand by your side, though you may not see me,
I'm here, and that's a promise I keep.
I've seen you cry, my dear friend, it's clear,
But please don't weep, for I am always near.

I come to visit from time to time,
A phantom whisper, love so sublime.
I'm close when you need me the most,
I've noticed your tears, and I softly sigh,
Rest assured, dear friend, I'm never truly far, oh so near.

Remember the days, those moments so sweet,
Together we crafted a space so complete.
The joy we shared, the love that's so wide,
In your heart, I'll forever reside.

Though I've journeyed to a world unknown,
Our bond endures, like seeds in the wind are sown.
With each sunset's glow and dawn's first light,
I'm by your side, my love shines through, a flicker in the light.

Be patient, dear friend, in your journey's stride,
I'm your guardian angel, walking by your side.
Until the day, when the time is right, in a realm so vast and true,
A world where we'll reunite, both wondrous and bright.

In that sacred space, where tears turn to grace,
We'll meet again, in a warm embrace.
No more goodbyes, just love's sweet refrain,
In a world where happiness will forever reign.
